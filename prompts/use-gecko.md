# Standard Gecko Prompt

Use Gecko for this job.

Job listing/source:
[PASTE JOB URL OR JOB DESCRIPTION HERE]

Instructions:
- Read `GECKO_SYSTEM.md` and `AGENTS.md` first.
- Execute the requested workflow live by default: generate the real resume, perform the necessary managed tracker writes, and verify the saved file and affected cells by reading them back. Use dry-run or preview modes only when I explicitly request read-only behavior; do not ask me to reconfirm writes already authorized here.
- Use only `input/master-resume/master-resume-v4.docx` for resume facts and use `input/master-resume/MODEL-GECKO-PRODUCT_Dave_Call_Resume.pdf` as the required visual formatting/layout model. Stop if either file is missing; never fall back to an older or tailored resume.
- Run `python scripts/gecko_v2.py plan` on the archived listing before changing the resume. Review supported, review, and gap items and the source quotes in the plan.
- Read the matching live Job Scout row by stable identity before generation. If `Resume Created` is `X` after trimming and case normalization, stop resume generation and preserve its marker and link, even when the link is blank; report a blank link for manual review.
- Create a dedicated scratch subfolder: `scratch/{Company-Name}+{JobNumber}/` for all temporary files (previews, PNGs, PDFs, intermediate files). Sanitize company names for Windows filenames.
- Reusable tools and scripts reside in `scripts/`.
- Tailor the resume subtly and naturally to this role.
- Generate from the V2 plan with `python scripts/gecko_v2.py generate`; review the rendered resume and `v2-qa.json`. Resolve QA failures before finalizing.
- Keep it exactly two pages.
- Preserve Gecko formatting conventions.
- Require at least 8 master-supported, job-relevant Core Strengths in professional Title Case and at least 8 master-supported, job-relevant Tools & Platforms with official brand capitalization.
- Format every Professional Experience job on one physical line as `Job Title - Company Name - City, ST` at left and verified employment dates flush right, with a single space around each normal hyphen. Use verified master DOCX fields and check every rendered line for wrapping or overlap.
- Run Gecko's structural cleanup/validation before final save and correct any section-count, capitalization, single-line employment-header, or lowercase-placeholder failure.
- Show verified employment dates at the right text margin on the same physical line as every job heading.
- Save the finished DOCX in `output/resumes/` using Gecko filename rules: `Dave-Call+<Company-Name>+<Job-Title>+<Resume-ID>.docx`.
- Save the archived listing in `input/job-descriptions/` as `<Company-Name>+<job-number>.md`.
- Only after the final resume has been successfully created and validated, upsert the job in the canonical Google Sheet with `scripts/manage_job_tracker.py add`, then validate the tracker. Do not create or update a local Excel tracker. Preserve existing rows and manual Applied/Contacted values.


## Permanent short resume filename rule

Resume filenames must use `Dave-Call+<Company-Name>+<Job-Title>+<Resume-ID>.docx`, ending in a unique numeric identifier of at most five digits (Gecko uses five zero-padded digits). Never put a full posting ID, Indeed jk, UUID, hash, or long numeric job number in a resume filename. Keep filenames at most 150 characters, sanitizing Windows-invalid characters and shortening an excessively long title at a word boundary. Reserve identifiers through `job-scout/resume_naming.py`; do not truncate a source ID or guess uniqueness. Full posting IDs remain in the identity registry and DOCX metadata for job matching. Use the same rule for explicitly requested renames, verify tracker links after any rename, and preserve the existing Resume Created = X guard. Archived job descriptions and scratch folders continue to use full posting IDs.

Example: `Dave-Call+Array+Digital-Marketing-Manager+00001.docx`.

For each job description, select only relevant, source-supported facts from the version 4 master. The master is a career archive, not content to include in full; keep the established two-page resume format.

Read the version 4 Word master directly for every resume, including paragraphs, tables, and list items. No text export, older master, or cover letter is an alternate factual source. Fill as much of both pages as practical with relevant, distinct, master-supported evidence; never add filler or inflate spacing to fill pages. The master cover letter is reserved for a later explicit request.

## Resume content density

Exactly two pages is necessary but not sufficient when useful, job-relevant evidence remains. Education & Certifications should finish within approximately 0.5 inch (36 points) above the normal bottom text boundary on page two. Use distinct, source-supported accomplishments and relevant project detail, prioritizing the most relevant roles; there is no fixed two- or three-bullet ceiling. Keep standard sections, readable model typography, and normal margins/spacing. Do not fill space with larger fonts, inflated spacing, blank paragraphs, repeated claims, unrelated material, or an education footer/text box. Inspect both rendered pages and measure the final section after native Word/PDF validation. If genuinely relevant evidence is exhausted, document the reviewed evidence and explain the remaining gap; page count alone is not completion.

## Job-specific resume headline - user instruction October 26, 2026

For EVERY resume, customize the specialization/main title directly below Dave's
name to the exact job's responsibilities, priorities, and required skills. Read
`Variations of Specialization/Main Titles` in the current
`input/master-resume/master-resume-v4.docx`. These are examples, not a closed list:
select, combine, or create the best concise, natural headline supported by Dave's
actual master-resume experience. Lead with the most relevant specialization; omit
unrelated areas and unsupported expertise, seniority, credentials, or claims.
Never automatically reuse `Marketing Technology/AI | Paid Media | E-Commerce |
Analytics | Digital Marketing` across jobs. It is acceptable only when its full
emphasis is genuinely the best fit after reviewing that specific posting.

Review the headline together with the summary and supporting accomplishments,
then inspect its rendered fit in the established header and two-page layout.
The generator ranks master examples as an initial suggestion; the agent must
review suitability and may create better wording. For a custom headline, call
`scripts/gecko_v2.py`'s `set_reviewed_headline(plan, headline, rationale)` before
generation, recording why its claims are supported and relevant. Never bypass
headline validation or copy the master default into every plan. This headline is
professional positioning; preserve verified employment titles and filename/job
identity rules. Existing completed resumes are not regenerated without a request.

## Usable Google Sheets resume links - October 26, 2026

Dave explicitly selected PRIVATE GOOGLE DRIVE LINKS, usable across devices.
Every new resume's Resume Link must be a clickable HTTPS link to the exact
completed DOCX in his private Drive. Keep the validated local DOCX for job
applications. A raw local path or `file:///` URI is not usable in Google Sheets;
HYPERLINK cannot fix that unsupported protocol. This instruction supersedes all
earlier no-upload and raw-file-URI requirements for resume delivery only. Never
make resumes public, convert the validated DOCX, or share them with others.

After native Word and visual QA, upload the exact final DOCX with the connected
Google Drive `upload_file` tool, preserving its filename and DOCX MIME type. Use
the private folder configured in `job-scout/preferences/resume-delivery.json`:
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Noy8XUqlL5ufqA4aU9jZWdwpMYeCVmol`.
Reuse a verified unchanged upload instead of creating duplicates. Read back the
Drive metadata (ID, observed URL, filename, MIME type, size, parents and private
owner-only permissions), download its raw bytes and compare SHA-256 with the
local DOCX. Save a receipt JSON containing `path`, `metadata` from that readback,
and `download: {"sha256": "<actual downloaded SHA-256>"}`. Register it using
`scripts/register_resume_drive_link.py --receipt <receipt.json>`.

The canonical publisher resolves that verified receipt to its observed HTTPS
URL. Write Resume Link as a clickable Google Sheets hyperlink, verify the cell's
actual hyperlink target, and preserve completion dates, job identity, formulas,
formatting and unrelated fields. Resume Created still requires all existing QA
and completion safeguards. If the connector is unavailable, retain the finished
local file and report Private Drive publication pending; do not silently fall
back to file:/// or claim a working tracker link. Unattended queue runs without
a registered delivery receipt stop at this publication gate and need a connected
agent to perform the upload. Dashboard and applications resolve registered Drive
URLs back to the unchanged local file through `job-scout/resume_delivery.py`.

## Canadian remote jobs allowed - user instruction October 26, 2026

Dave explicitly instructed: If it is Canada, allow it. Treat Canadian remote
jobs, including Canada-only postings and country codes CA/CAN, as geographically
eligible for Gecko discovery, qualification, resume queues and tracker review.
Do not set Qualifies to Apply? to No solely because the country is Canada or the
ATS applicant country is Canadian. This supersedes earlier U.S./Utah-only remote
country restrictions for Canada. Marketbridge ID 2983 is the confirmed example.

Keep other safeguards: fees, permanent rejections, completed-resume protection,
match thresholds, usable job descriptions, and genuine additional location or
residency restrictions. Required Eastern working hours alone are not an Eastern
residency restriction. This does not authorize inventing Canadian citizenship,
work authorization, residency or willingness to relocate; answer application
questions truthfully and surface any unsupported mandatory requirement. The
exception permits remote Canada jobs; it does not make Canadian onsite/hybrid
jobs local Utah jobs or permit every other foreign-country requisition.
